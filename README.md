# Campaign Performance ETL Analysis

This project simulates a real-world data engineering task focused on extracting, transforming,
and analyzing marketing campaign data.

The goal is to compare planned and actual campaign investments on a daily and cumulative basis.
Data is extracted from Azure Blob Storage using secure access (SAS token), cleaned and aggregated
using Python, and visualized to evaluate campaign performance over time.

The project is designed as a small-scale ETL pipeline and reflects typical workflows used in
data engineering environments (e.g. Keboola, Azure Data Factory, Databricks).
